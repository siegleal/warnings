                "description": "-This Weekend-\n\nAnother quick-moving system will sweep through the Sierra and\nwestern Nevada bringing more breezy conditions and potential for\nsome showers. Temperatures will be relatively mild and the breezes\nmay result in choppy lake conditions for a brief period on Lake\nTahoe and Pyramid Lake. There is also a 15% chance for\nthunderstorms, but your best bet for those will be north of\nGerlach on Saturday.\n\n\n-Monday Winds-\n\nYou guessed it. Another round of showers and winds, but this storm\nwill bring more of a wind punch than previous systems. Confidence\nis high for widespread wind gusts 40 to 50 mph with locally higher\nwind gusts for those wind prone areas. There is potential for\ndownslope enhancement of the wind gusts, which would boost the\npeak wind gusts for areas along the Highway 395 and Interstate 580\ncorridor.\n\nPlan on impacts to aviation, recreation, with the\npotential for another round of high profile vehicle restrictions\nas well as areas of blowing dust. There will be very dry\nconditions along with the gusty winds, which may result in\ncritical fire conditions, especially across West Central Nevada.\nTake precautions now to secure outdoor items, check flight/road\nplans, and avoid activities that could ignite a spark.",
