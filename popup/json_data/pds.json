Temperatures will be relatively mild and the breezes\nmay result in choppy lake conditions for a brief period on Lake\nTahoe and Pyramid Lake. There is also a 15% chance for\nthunderstorms, but your best bet for those will be north of\nGerlach on Saturday.\n\n\n-Monday Winds-\n\nYou guessed it. Another round of showers and winds, but this storm\nwill bring more of a wind punch than previous systems. Confidence\nis high for widespread wind gusts 40 to 50 mph with locally higher\nwind gusts for those wind prone areas. There is potential for\ndownslope enhancement of the wind gusts, which would boost the\npeak wind gusts for areas along the Highway 395 and Interstate 580\ncorridor.\n\nPlan on impacts to aviation, recreation, with the\npotential for another round of high profile vehicle restrictions\nas well as areas of blowing dust. There will be very dry\nconditions along with the gusty winds, which may result in\ncritical fire conditions, especially across West Central Nevada.\nTake precautions now to secure outdoor items, check flight/road\nplans, and avoid activities that could ignite a spark.",

                "description": "High temperatures this weekend will be in the 50s to around 60\nwith overnight lows only falling to around freezing for much of\nthe southeast Interior. Rapid melting of the snowpack will\ncontinue. Most of the Southeast Interior still has a significant\namount of water in the saturated snow pack that has not been\nreleased. Overflow can be found on many of the still frozen\nlakes, ponds, streams, and rivers.\n\nWater will continue to pond in low lying areas, and could produce\nminor flooding issue in areas where drainage remains frozen or is\npoor. People in low lying or poorly drained areas should prepare\nfor potential flooding that could develop as the snowmelt\naccelerates. Preparations include clearing ice out of drain pipes,\nculverts and drainage ditches. Preparations also include moving\nvehicles to higher ground, and moving valuables in basements and\ngarages to shelves above the ground.\n\nRiver breakup is expected soon, and the snowmelt runoff crest of\nrivers will generally occur 1 to 2 weeks after breakup occurs.\n\nFor the latest Warning, Advisories and forecasts go to\nwww.weather.gov/fairbanks, and for the latest river forecasts go\nto www.weather.gov/aprfc.",
